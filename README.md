# Cyclomatic and Cognitive complextity examples

## What

This project contains PHP scripts that will allow you to calculate the
complexity of PHP code.

The complexity is calculated based on the following formula:

```
cognitive complexity * cyclomatic complexity = total complexity
```

Currently this project only calculates complexitiy at a (class) function level.

In order to calculate the complexity of a given piece of code, call the script
on the bin directory:

```
$ php ./bin/calculate-complexity.php ./src/*.php

           File : ./src/CognitiveComplexityScanner.php
        Methods : 1 = cy(1) * co(1)
                  6 = cy(3) * co(2)

           File : ./src/CyclomaticComplexityScanner.php
        Methods : 1 = cy(1) * co(1)
                  6 = cy(3) * co(2)
                  20 = cy(5) * co(4)
```

## Why

I got tired of people having unfounded opinions about what "readability" means.

There is [an interesting whitepaper](https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf)
on this topic, which uses the term "Cognitive Complexity". As I could not find a
tool that allowed me to easily calculate both Cognitive and Cyclomatic
Complexity in an easy manner, I build one myself.

## How

I've basically just combined the logic behind two PHP Code Sniffs:

- `PHP_CodeSniffer\Standards\Generic\Sniffs\Metrics\CyclomaticComplexitySniff`
- `Symplify\CodingStandard\Sniffs\CleanCode\CognitiveComplexitySniff`

Instead of returning a true/false sort-of response when a given threshold is
crossed, I just made the code output a number.
